# ChatApp

This is a practice Live Chat App build with **Webpack** and **Socket.io**.
___

To test the app, run:

* **node index.js**
* This will spin up the server on port 3000 and serve the static files.

Next open new terminal window and run:

* **npm start**
* This, by default, will open new browser tab (http://localhost:8080) with the ChatApp.
* Add new username.
* Then open new browser window on the same port: (http://localhost:8080) and add another user.

* Changes in the chat windows should be updated in real time simultaneously.
